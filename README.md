# autodiff
Autodiff graph, in rust, ~~for my final highschool programming project~~ because I wan't to.

The idea is to be able to create optimized (compiled from expression trees) algebraic objects, that are differentiable.

# Features
- Statically sized matricies
- GPU support
- Blas and all that stuff

# MVP
I'm working on implementing the different operations, on the different backends.
After that, I'm going to implement backwards-autodiff.
